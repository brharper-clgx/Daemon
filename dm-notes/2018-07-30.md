After taking an "easy job" from a couple of treasurers, Dain and Corvus find themselves captured by the drow.  After several days travel of unknown length they awaken to find one of the drow is acting very peculiar.  He leads the group into koa-toa territory and is immediately taken captive himself.  

They get a quick lesson about the brutality of the koa-toa as they watch as their new "friends" are sacrificed to the deep father.  They fear they will be next and they see no way out.

At the same time in a different place, Buppido shows his true colors as he poisons the group. Two are left paralyzed and must watch as he chooses his victims and take trophies from them.  Hours later the paralysis wears off and in an effort to clean things up an idol is found with quite a lot of gold/jewels.

Daemon and Shirra then try to flee this madness only to be caught and taken to the sacrificial pits.

Word reaches the Deep Mother elder about their capture and Bloop makes a quick attempt to save the party.  In the confusion that follows a new foe appears more terrifying than anything any have seen before. Demons haunt the underdark.

Shirra, Deamon, and Dain are stricken with forms of madness but have enough sense to flee this place.  The party steals some boats and makes a break for it as demogorgon destroys the city behind them.

The characters have a difficult road ahead with Grackslug weeks away and no ideas on an escape route yet.  Sarith and toad push the party to Neverlight grove.
